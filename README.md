## Nick Butler

Following a succesful career in Technical Theatre, I have taken the leap and joined Makers Academy to take my logical 
thinking, problem solving, technically orientated skills and redeploy them in pursuit of a new exciting path as a 
Junior Software Developer.

I am excited about a career change into a perenially growing, dynamic field.


## Team player 

My greatest achievement in my previous career was staffing from scratch the newest London Theatre complex, 'The Other Palace'.
I joined when the site was a hole in the ground and was involved in its inception and for 5 hugely enjoyable years. 
The best part of this was creating a technical team, with Lighting, Sound and Stage technicians and being instrumental in 
forming the way that team worked and thrived. 

#### Born facilitator

As a Technical Manager my raison d'etre was realising the ideas and inspirations of talented designers. I worked with 
Directors, Set and Costume designers, Lighting and Sound Designers, to bring their creative imaginings to life in whatever
venue I was responsible for. Often pushing at the limits of what ancient buildings could take and audiences could comprehend.
I am excited to bring this strength to bear in realising the wants and needs of clients with bold, exciting software 
requirements.

#### Detail orientated

Another hugely important part of my professional life to this point has been Health and Safety. The attention to detail
required when working with a 20ft flame curtain, or a 10 tonne articulated wall and making sure everyone is not only safe
but confident with how to interact with these potentially lethal effects, is not something to be ignored.

Force myself to run, then really enjoy it.

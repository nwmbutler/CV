Following a successful career in Technical Theatre, I have taken the leap into software development to take my logical thinking, problem-solving, technically orientated skills, such as intelligent lighting systems and computer-aided design and redeploy them in pursuit of an exciting new career.

## Technical Experience
#### Makers Academy (April 2020 to August 2020) - Full-stack Software Development Bootcamp.
A four-month, fulltime, intensive Bootcamp prioritising TDD, BDD, OOP and Agile processes. It has armed me to TDD anything, program fluently, debug anything, model anything, refactor anything and most importantly it focussed on learning to learn.
Just two examples of the projects I worked on during the course are below;


# Projects

Small Steps, a carbon footprint calculator. This was my ten day final group project at Makers academy.
- We practised Agile processes, with daily stand-ups and retros, to create an optimal learning space in which to work effectively as a team.

It was built with a React Front-End and a Node/Express Backend. Testing was with Jest.

Acebook, a Facebook clone which was built using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, as my penultimate group project at Makers academy.
- We focussed on code quality and testing, maintaining 100% coverage throughout. Continuous integration and deployment were central to our process.
